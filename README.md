- **Card**: A container component commonly used to display content with a consistent visual style, often including a title, image, and description.

- **Painter (Image)**: This component is used for displaying images, allowing for additional customization such as applying filters or transformations.

- **Lazy Column**: Similar to Column, but the column can be scrolled.

## Theming (ColorScheme & Font)

- **Font**: Specifies the typeface and styles (such as weight and size) used for text elements, contributing to the overall visual identity of the app.
